## 10:36:00 PATRICK CHALLENGE!

IF storing data OFF-CHAIN, how to ensure decentralization of this information?
-> IPFS (Inter planetary File System)
-> IPFS + FILECOIN
    Full solution ^^^
-> METADATA
    -> ONCHAIN METADATA
    -> OFFCHAIN METADATA
-> INTERACTABLE NFTS
    NFT marketplaces right now only know how to pull metadata from the tokenURI.
    If you with to produce interactable NFTs, with more advanced features, the tokenURI will not suffice.
    Use tokenURI for the visuals, but everything else must be coded ON-CHAIN!


--> ERROS:
REMEMBER DOTENV!! Unable to expand environment variable in host setting: 'https://goerli.infura.io/v3/$WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'

REMEMBER DEPLOYMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE WAITING! IT DOESN'T HAVE THIS FUNCTIONALITY.
------------------------

## Advanced Collectible
--> we need to add a few features.

- The scarcity and the auditability of it in-CHAIN
- The randomness and the auditability of it in-CHAIN
- Adding an image to IPFS and linking it to it, as well as understanding why is it decentralized.

--> For the randomness, again, we'll need the chainlink VRFCoordinators and some linktokens.
- Import into the contract the VRFConsumerBase
- Do the necessary dependencies and remappings in the config file
- Make the contract inherit the VRFConsumerBase and its constructor as well 
- Receive the necessary parameters.
