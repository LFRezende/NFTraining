IF storing data OFF-CHAIN, how to ensure decentralization of this information?
-> IPFS (Inter planetary File System)
-> IPFS + FILECOIN
    Full solution ^^^
-> METADATA
    -> ONCHAIN METADATA
    -> OFFCHAIN METADATA
-> INTERACTABLE NFTS
    NFT marketplaces right now only know how to pull metadata from the tokenURI.
    If you with to produce interactable NFTs, with more advanced features, the tokenURI will not suffice.
    Use tokenURI for the visuals, but everything else must be coded ON-CHAIN!
